# Master Thesis project
Following the boycotts directed at Starbucks due to the union workers' strike and the conflict in Gaza, I am interested in examining the impact on the brand's reputation within both the US and Europe. 
To achieve this, I plan to conduct a sentiment analysis of news headlines to capture regional variations. 
This method will enable a detailed assessment of how the brand's public perception has been affected in different geographical areas.
